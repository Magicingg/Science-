                    <p>A growing body of scientific evidence indicates that pollutants are having a detrimental impact on vital ecosystems, including marine, forest, and tundra environments. These contaminants, encompassing a wide range of substances from industrial chemicals to plastic debris, are disrupting natural ecological processes and posing significant threats to biodiversity. The introduction of these foreign substances into delicate ecosystems is not merely an aesthetic issue; it represents a profound alteration of the fundamental biological interactions that sustain life.</p>
                    <div class="wrapper2">
                        <img src="POLLUTANTS.jpg" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>In marine environments, the accumulation of pollutants such as microplastics and chemical runoff is leading to bioaccumulation within the food chain. Organisms at lower trophic levels, such as krill and zooplankton, ingest these contaminants, which are then transferred and concentrated in higher-level predators, including fish, seals, and whales. Similarly, forest ecosystems are experiencing adverse effects from airborne pollutants and soil contamination, impacting plant growth and the health of terrestrial fauna. In tundra regions, long-range transport of pollutants from industrial areas is resulting in the deposition of harmful substances, affecting the stability of these fragile, slow-growing ecosystems. The pervasive nature of these pollutants necessitates immediate and comprehensive action to mitigate their impact and safeguard the integrity of these critical habitats.</p>

                            <P>A photochemical reaction is a chemical change triggered by light energy.  Essentially, when light hits certain molecules, it excites them, providing the energy needed to break or form chemical bonds. This process allows reactions to occur that wouldn't happen in the dark or at lower temperatures.  Think of it like sunlight powering a chemical engine, driving transformations in substances.  Photosynthesis in plants is a prime example, where sunlight fuels the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into sugars and oxygen. Photochemical reactions also play a role in atmospheric chemistry, like the formation of smog, and in technological applications like photography and solar energy conversion.</P>

                            <h1>Covalent Bonds in Pollutants</h1>

                            <p>A covalent bond is a chemical bond where atoms share electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration. These bonds are common in organic pollutants, which are carbon-based compounds, but they can also be present in some inorganic pollutants.</p>
                        
                            <h1>How Covalent Bonds Hold Pollutants Together</h1>
                            <div class="wrapper">
                                <img src="methane.jpg" alt="" width="250">
                            </div>

                                <li>Atoms want to achieve a <strong>stable electron configuration</strong>, usually following the octet rule (having 8 electrons in their outer shell). For example, carbon has 4 valence electrons and needs 4 more to complete its octet. It does this by forming covalent bonds with other atoms, sharing electrons instead of transferring them like in ionic bonds.
                                    <p>
                                    <strong>Example: In methane (CH‚ÇÑ), carbon forms four covalent bonds with hydrogen, sharing electrons to complete both their outer shells.</strong>
                                </p></li>
                                <li>Covalent bonds involve shared electron pairs, which makes them difficult to break under normal conditions. This stability means that pollutants with covalent bonds (like plastics and PCBs) do not break down easily in the environment, leading to long-term pollution.

                                    <p><strong>Example: PCBs (Polychlorinated Biphenyls) persist in nature for decades because their C-Cl covalent bonds are highly stable and resistant to degradation.</strong></p>


                                    
                                        <li>Non-polar covalent pollutants (like oils and many pesticides) do not dissolve well in water because they lack charged regions that interact with water molecules.</li>
                                    <li><p>Polar covalent pollutants (like sulfur dioxide, SO‚ÇÇ) dissolve in water but do not break into ions like ionic compounds (e.g., salt). Instead, they remain intact as molecules, which can still impact the environment.</p></li>

                            <p>An ionic bond is formed when one atom transfers electrons to another, creating oppositely charged ions that are held together by electrostatic attraction. These bonds are mostly found in inorganic pollutants, but some organic pollutants can also exist as ionic salts.

                                <li>A metal (cation, +) donates electrons to a non-metal (anion, -), forming a strong electrostatic attraction.</li>
                                <li>Ionic bonds break in water, allowing pollutants to dissolve and spread easily.</li>

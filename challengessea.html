                    <h1 class="title">Challenges Facing Marine Ecosystems</h1>
                
                    <p>The oceans cover over 70% of the Earth's surface and support an incredible diversity of life. However, marine ecosystems are under severe pressure from human activities, leading to declining ocean health. Overexploitation, pollution, and climate change are disrupting biodiversity, breaking food chains, and endangering coastal environments, pushing marine ecosystems to the brink of collapse.</p>
                
                <div class="text">
                    <h1>Overfishing</h1>
                    <div class="wrapper2"><img src="overfishing.jpg" alt=""></div>
                    <p>One of the most pressing challenges is overfishing, where fish are harvested at rates faster than they can reproduce. This practice leads to the depletion of fish stocks, reducing populations of key species and disrupting marine food webs. Many large predatory fish, such as tuna and sharks, have seen drastic declines, affecting the balance of oceanic ecosystems. Overfishing also threatens the livelihoods of millions who depend on the fishing industry, particularly in coastal communities that rely on fish as a primary protein source. Compounding this issue is bycatch, the unintentional capture of non-target species such as dolphins, sea turtles, and seabirds. Many of these species suffer injuries or die in fishing nets, further reducing biodiversity and altering marine ecological structures.</p>
                
                    <h1>Coral Bleaching</h1>
                        <div class="wrapper"><img src="coralbleaching.jpg" alt="" width="300px"></div>
                    <p>Another significant challenge is coral bleaching, a phenomenon caused by rising ocean temperatures due to climate change. Corals have a symbiotic relationship with microscopic algae that provide them with nutrients and vibrant colors. When ocean temperatures rise, corals expel these algae, turning white and becoming vulnerable to disease and death. Coral reefs support around 25% of all marine species, meaning their decline has a cascading effect on entire ecosystems. The loss of healthy coral reefs also leaves coastal communities more exposed to storm surges and erosion, as reefs act as natural barriers against extreme weather events.</p>
                
                    <h1>Pollution</h1>
                    <div class="wrapper2"><img src="waterpollution.webp" alt="" width="350px" height="200px"></div>
                    <p>Pollution is another critical threat to marine ecosystems, with plastic waste being one of the most pervasive issues. Millions of tons of plastic enter the ocean each year, where they are ingested by marine animals who mistake them for food. This leads to injury, starvation, and death, with devastating effects on fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. In addition, plastics break down into microplastics, which infiltrate the food chain and pose risks to both marine life and human health. Beyond plastics, chemical pollution from industrial and agricultural runoff introduces harmful substances such as pesticides, heavy metals, and fertilizers into the ocean. This contamination contributes to the formation of algal blooms, which create oxygen-depleted dead zones where marine life cannot survive. Oil spills further compound pollution issues, as toxic crude oil coats marine animals and coastal habitats, leading to long-term environmental damage.</p>
                
                    <h1>Ocean Acidification</h1>
                    <div class="wrapper"><img src="oceanacidification.jpg" alt="" width="250px" height="200px"> </div>
                    <p>Ocean acidification, driven by increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere, presents another hidden yet severe challenge. As oceans absorb CO2, the water becomes more acidic, disrupting the ability of marine organisms such as corals, shellfish, and plankton to form calcium carbonate structures. This weakens entire food chains, affecting both marine biodiversity and fisheries. If acidification continues unchecked, it could significantly alter marine ecosystems and reduce the availability of key species that support human economies and food supplies.</p>
                
                    <h1>Coastal Development</h1>
                    <div class="wrapper2"><img src="coastaldevelopment.jpg" alt=""></div>
                    <p>Coastal development is rapidly destroying vital marine habitats such as mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds. Urban expansion, industrialization, and tourism have led to habitat destruction, which not only reduces biodiversity but also increases the vulnerability of coastal regions to flooding and extreme weather. These coastal ecosystems serve as nurseries for many marine species, and their loss disrupts breeding cycles and reduces fish populations. Additionally, coastal infrastructure development often leads to pollution and sedimentation that degrade nearby marine environments.</p>

                    <h1>Sunken Ships</h1>
                    <div class="wrapper"><img src="sunkenship.avif" alt=""></div>
                    <p>Sunken ships can severely damage the ocean ecosystem in several ways. First, they may leak hazardous substances such as oil, fuel, and toxic chemicals, which can poison marine life and disrupt food chains. These pollutants can spread over large areas, suffocating corals, contaminating fish, and harming seabirds that rely on clean water for survival. Additionally, shipwrecks can introduce invasive species that hitch a ride on the hull or cargo, upsetting the natural balance by outcompeting native marine organisms. The physical structure of a sunken ship can also cause damage, crushing fragile coral reefs and altering the natural seafloor habitat, making it unsuitable for species that depend on stable environments. Over time, the corrosion of metal shipwrecks can release heavy metals into the water, further affecting water quality and marine biodiversity. While some shipwrecks eventually become artificial reefs that support marine life, many cause more harm than good, particularly if they contain harmful materials or land in sensitive ecosystems.</p>
                
                    <h1>Climate Change</h1>
                    <div class="wrapper2"><img src="climatechangewater.webp" alt=""></div>
                    <p>Climate change is further exacerbating marine ecosystem challenges, as warming waters force species to migrate, altering ecosystem dynamics. Some species struggle to adapt to new environments, leading to declines in biodiversity. Melting polar ice threatens species that depend on ice-covered waters, such as polar bears and krill, while rising sea levels endanger coastal habitats. Climate change also increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and typhoons, which cause physical damage to marine habitats and disrupt ecological stability.</p>
                
                    <h1>Invasive Species</h1>
                    <div class="wrapper"><img src="invasivespeciesocean.jpg" alt=""></div>
                    <p>Invasive species poses yet another challenge, often introduced into marine ecosystems through ballast water discharged from ships or accidental releases. These non-native species can outcompete native marine life for resources, leading to imbalances in food webs. The lionfish invasion in the Atlantic Ocean, for example, has significantly impacted native fish populations due to its rapid reproduction and lack of natural predators. Invasive species can also introduce diseases that native species have no resistance against, further destabilizing ecosystems.</p>

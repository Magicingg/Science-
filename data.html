                            <h1>Air Pollution</h1>
                            <p>Air pollution involves the release of harmful substances into the atmosphere, leading to adverse health effects and environmental degradation. It's a pervasive issue affecting cities worldwide.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Only 17% of the world's cities meet air pollution guidelines. (AP NEWS)</li>
                                <li>Long-term exposure can lead to respiratory illnesses, Alzheimer's, and cancer. (AP NEWS)</li>
                                <li>Approximately 7 million premature deaths annually. (WHO)</li>
                                <li>99% of the global population breathes air exceeding WHO limits. (WHO)</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>What You Can Do:</strong> Try using public transport, cycling, or walking instead of driving whenever possible. Choosing energy-efficient appliances and reducing your home's energy use also makes a difference. Support local efforts to improve air quality, and avoid burning leaves or trash in your backyard.</p>
                
                            <h1>Water Pollution</h1>
                            <p>Water pollution occurs when harmful substances contaminate water bodies, affecting aquatic life and human health. The contamination of our water sources has dire consequences.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>1.5 million child deaths in 2021. (OIZOM)</li>
                                <li>80% of wastewater discharged untreated. (UNESCO)</li>
                                <li>Over 2 billion people lack safe drinking water. (WHO/UNICEF)</li>
                                <li>Agricultural runoff: 78% of ocean and freshwater pollution. (FAO)</li>
                                <li>Plastic waste: 85% of marine pollution. (UNEP)</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>What You Can Do:</strong> Be mindful of what goes down your drainsâ€”avoid pouring chemicals or oils. Use eco-friendly cleaning products, and reduce your use of single-use plastics. Conserve water, and properly dispose of medications. You can also support organizations working to protect our water resources.</p>
                
                            <h1>Soil Pollution</h1>
                            <p>Soil pollution involves the contamination of soil with hazardous substances, impacting agriculture and ecosystems. Degraded soil leads to reduced fertility and crop contamination.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>~33% of world's soil degraded due to pollution and erosion. (FAO)</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>What You Can Do:</strong> Start composting your food waste. Opt for natural fertilizers and pesticides in your garden. Planting trees and maintaining green spaces helps too. Make sure to properly dispose of hazardous waste, and consider buying from local farmers who use sustainable practices.</p>
                
                            <h1>Plastic Pollution</h1>
                            <p>Plastic pollution refers to the accumulation of plastic objects and particles in the environment, harming wildlife and ecosystems. The sheer volume of plastic waste is overwhelming our planet.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>1 million plastic drinking bottles purchased every minute. (UNEP)</li>
                                <li>500 billion single-use plastic bags used annually. (UNEP)</li>
                                <li>Plastics: ~3.3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. (OUR WORLD IN DATA)</li>
                                <li>~14 million tonnes of plastic enter the ocean annually. (IUCN)</li>
                                <li>By 2050, plastic may outweigh fish in the ocean. (Ellen MacArthur Foundation)</li>
                                <li>Over 90% of seabirds have plastic in their stomachs. (National Geographic)</li>
                                <li>Only 9% of plastic waste ever produced has been recycled. (UNEP)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>What You Can Do:</strong> Make a conscious effort to reduce your use of single-use plastics. Carry reusable bags, bottles, and containers. Recycle properly, and avoid products with excessive plastic packaging. You can also participate in local beach or park cleanups.</p>
                
                            <h1>Light Pollution</h1>
                            <p>Light pollution involves excessive or misdirected artificial light, disrupting ecosystems and obscuring the night sky. The overabundance of artificial light has far-reaching effects.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>~80% of the world's population lives under skyglow. (New World Atlas of Artificial Night Sky Brightness)</li>
                                <li>Light pollution increases ~2% annually. (Science Advances)</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>What You Can Do:</strong> Turn off lights when you don't need them. Use shielded outdoor lighting to direct light downwards. Close your blinds at night to prevent light from escaping. You can also advocate for responsible lighting in your community and educate others about the impact of light pollution.</p>
                
                            <h1>Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Pollution</h1>
                            <p>Climate change is driven by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to global warming and extreme weather events. The consequences are changing our planet's climate.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>~50 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases emitted yearly. (OUR WORLD IN DATA)</li>
                                <li>Extraction and processing contribute half of total emissions. (UNITED NATIONS)</li>
                                <li>Global temperatures up over 1.2Â°C since pre-industrial levels. (NASA)</li>
